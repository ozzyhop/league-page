  <p>The Federation of Degenerate Retards was founded in 2022 amongst a small group friends who never had indulged in dynasty fantasy football prior. Our league thrives due to our constant year long activity as well as constant trolling and banter.</p>
  <p>Some owners aim to compete every season, while others try to formulate plans for long term success, which may or may not include intentional tanking. Allegedly. Regardless, the ultimate goal is to hoist the Sacred Jug.</p>
  <p>Through our first two seasons we have had two different champions, as well as two different last place finishers. The champion of the inaugural season has retired and been replaced, but his mark has been made. Our most recent champion, Tiananmen Square, hopes to repeat in the upcoming 2024 season.</p>
  <p>The true ultimate prize in this league is bragging rights and the ability to send obnoxious over the top text messages that cause people to frequently leave chats. Western Kentucky. On top of that privilege, the winner will walk away with $770 and of course, the Sacred Jug.</p>
